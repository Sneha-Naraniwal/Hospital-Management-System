- **Python** (v3.8 or higher)
- **pip** (Python package manager)

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd healthcare-platform
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run database migrations
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create sample data (optional but recommended)
python manage.py create_sample_data

# Create superuser (optional)
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Start the Django development server
python manage.py runserver
```

The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory (in a new terminal)
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## 🔧 Configuration

### Backend Configuration

The backend uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:

```env
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
```

### Frontend Configuration

The frontend is configured to connect to the backend at `http://localhost:8000`. If you need to change this, update the `API_BASE_URL` in `frontend/src/services/api.ts`.

## 👥 Sample Data

The application includes a management command to create sample data for testing:

```bash
cd backend
python manage.py create_sample_data
```

This creates:
- **3 Sample Doctors** with different specializations
- **4 Sample Patients** with various medical conditions
- **Sample Appointments** (past and future)
- **Sample Medications** with different statuses
- **Sample Health Metrics** (blood pressure readings)
- **Sample Medical Advice** from doctors
- **Sample Progress Reports**

### Sample Login Credentials

After running the sample data command, you can login with:

**Doctors:**
- `sarah.wilson@hospital.com` / `password123` (General Medicine)
- `michael.chen@hospital.com` / `password123` (Cardiology)
- `emily.johnson@hospital.com` / `password123` (Pediatrics)
